#  Gesture Based User Interface Project Design Doc
#### By Mark Gill and Aaron Burns

## Original Idea
* Before the Conoravirus drastically altered the course of this project, our original idea was to create a gesture based boxing game in Unity similar to the old Nintendo game, Punchout. The hardware we had decided to use was a kinect. However due to the college being shut down and the ability to meet up and pass the hardware between us, as well as issues surronding the hardware itself, We had to drop this project idea. We put a lot of thought into this idea but dues to the circumstances unable to create it. 

* The new project specification mentioned using speech recognition as a gesture instead of what we originaly planned and that is what we did. Originally the idea was to create the game in Unity. This would not have been a problem for out team. As one of us is a windows used and the other is a Linux user and Unity is supported by that version of Linux. However because the bases for our project specification changed from visual gestures with the kinect to speech. We were unable to think of a way to utilise our original idea with speech commands.


## A Speech Recognition Brain Training Game
### Introduction
* Due to our original idea for the project (a Kinect boxing game) no longer being compatible with the hardware we are using, we decided to come up with a new idea. We spent some time trying to think of an idea that would work with speech gestures. We contemplated a number of games such as *Snake* or *Pong*. However we could find no way of making these games using speech commands that would be intuitive in the case of *Pong*, or fun in the case of *Snake*. For this reason we racked our brains in order to come up with an idea that would work better for speech gestures. We needed to think of an idea that would be based on speech and not just some game where the gameplay options are adapted into speech gestures.

### Project Overview
* The game we decided to build was a Brain training game using **Word and Colour** association. The player will see the word of a colour in a certain colour, for example: the word green in the colour red. The player will then be prompted to speak either the colour of the word they see or the word itself.
* We decided to code the project using python for a number of reasons one fo which is that we have become increasingly familiar with this language over the course of our final two years. Another reason for coding this project in python is because of the compact and easy to implement libraries make the project easy to implement quickly, We needed to consider ease of implementation and quick development because we needed to build a project from scratch and we couldn't salvage any of our original game. Finding these libraries was a god send for getting this project done.

### Purpose of the application
* The purpose of this project is a simple, easy to use brain training game. This game is obviously a speech operated, the game itself is built specifically to accommodate speech commands.
